Svelte, SCSS, and Babel setup -- current as of 3/7/20.

Preprocessing for SCSS files, creating two bundles -- extracted CSS and SCSS from Svelte components (componentBundle.css) and global files imported directly into JS (bundle.css).

Preprocessing includes Autoprefixer and CSSNano via PostCSS.

Basic Babel setup.
