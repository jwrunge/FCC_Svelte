To meet the needs of families in our neighborhood a blessing box was put in place on the south side of the building.  It is labeled: Take What You Need, Leave What You Can, Be Blessed.  Since its beginning in October of 2019, the box is visited daily.  We have discovered that not only is the need great, but the kindness of church and community members helps support this ministry.  Items may be placed directly in the box or in the barrel inside near the pastorâ€™s office. We are glad to divide bulk items into individual packages.</p><p>Items needed:</p><ul><li>Hygiene Items such as deodorant, soap, toothpaste, shampoo, razors</li><li>Personal Items such as toilet paper, pads/tampons, socks, hats, gloves</li><li>Baby items such as diapers and wipes</li><li>Cleaning supplies such as detergent, cleanser, trash bags, dish soap, paper towels</li><li>Non-perishable food items</li></ul>"
