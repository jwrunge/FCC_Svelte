then migrated to the United States.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
soon started working as a cook for wealthy families in New York City.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But there was something unusual about
Mary.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Medical authorities discovered
that wherever she worked, members of the family would come down with typhoid
fever &#8211; and some even died.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mary was
completely asymptomatic and did not believe that the illnesses and deaths had
anything to do with her.<sup>1<o:p></o:p></sup></span></p>

in isolation in a New York clinic for three years.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She went through a lot of medical testing
and was one of the first of many people to be diagnosed as an &#8220;asymptomatic
carrier&#8221; of typhoid fever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she was
released, she agreed to stop working as a cook and to be very careful to
prevent infecting others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a Hospital, affecting 25 workers and killing two.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The epidemic was traced back to the hospital
cook, who people had nicknamed &#8220;Typhoid Mary&#8221;.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Little did they know at the time, it was Mary Mallon who had changed her
name to Mary Brown. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mary had broken her
promise to stay out of the kitchen and in the end, 51 cases of typhoid could be
traced to Mary &#8211; 3 of whom died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This

is on the run from his son Absalom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>David had been king for several years and
fought many battles, but it was his own son Absalom who broke his heart by
leading a conspiracy against him.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;

flee to the wilderness in order to avoid the confrontation and potentially destroy

standing in the hot desert rocks of Judean hills &#8211; shoulders slumped as he is
exhausted physically, and emotionally &#8211; and yes, even spiritually.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He is as dry and empty as the landscape he
is looking at.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>His family has turned
against him and many of his subjects have rejected him &#8211; and he doesn&#8217;t know
what hope there is for his kingdom.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
notice, he doesn&#8217;t cry out for all the things he has lost &#8211; nor does he beg for
God to change everything and end his suffering. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Rather, he realizes that only God can heal
the brokenness in His life &#8211; so He begins his prayer by saying that he is
seeking God <i>earnestly</i>.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He is not
just saying just a simple prayer &#8211;no, he is yearning for God and seeking him
with all his heart, soul, and mind.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>His
deepest need is to be in close communication and relationship with God.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So, his soul longs for &#8211; and can only be
satisfied by &#8211; a close, deep relationship with God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

tabernacle.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I think he is longing to
have that time of worship again.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
think about it - he is cut off from the sanctuary and away from the worshipping
people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And his soul is yearning to have
that worship &#8211; that time of prayer and connection with God&#8217;s people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

having corporate worship in our sanctuary.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;

our midst as we share in communion together.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There have been so many times, I have felt and known God&#8217;s power and

and spirit.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Learn to praise God <u>regardless</u>
of your personal circumstances, and you&#8217;ll see miracles occur.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You heart and mind will be renewed.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Your perspective will widen
panoramically.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And your attitude toward
God will never be the same.&#8221;</i><sup>4</sup><i><span style="">&nbsp;
</span></i>You will start to find hope and strength and power.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>God will fill you up with His living water &#8211;
and you will begin to have an inner satisfaction - as David says in verse 5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of being empty and dry &#8211; you will be
filled up<span style="">&nbsp; </span>with the Spirit of God, which
can bring an inner calm and peace that passes all understanding.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The best way to change an anxious and
worried heart is to have a praising and grateful heart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

what he does in verses 6 &amp; 7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
once again turns to worshiping God and remembering who he is.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He says: <i>&#8220;I lie awake thinking of you,
