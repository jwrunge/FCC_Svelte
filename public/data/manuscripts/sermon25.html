</span>That is our topic for Eastertide this year. Last week, Pastor Greg talked
about all the hearts he saw as he drove around &#8211; hearts posted everywhere, on
windows and doors. And then &#8211; did you all see the great article in the <i>Knox
County Neighbors</i> newspaper about Galesburg&#8217;s own Krista Wynes who created
the Heart Hunters back in March? Krista envisioned the idea of the hearts as a
way to reach out to neighbors while staying home and social distancing. Her
hope was to spread kindness and bring people together. And incredibly, her idea
spread like wildfire. People throughout all 50 states and on all seven
continents and in 96 countries are putting these hearts up in their windows and
doors!!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And Krista was even commended
in a recent meeting of the United States House of Representatives! Who knew such
a simple act would make such a powerful impact! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoTitle" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN-US"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoTitle" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those hearts seem to me, to bring hope &#8211; and express love
&#8211; and unity&#8230; that we are all in this together &#8211; literally all around the world!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoTitle" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN-US"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoTitle" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have reflected on those hearts throughout this week&#8230;and
as I have watched the news about COVID 19 &#8211; I kept thinking, you know a lot of
those hearts really could be broken hearts. I am so amazed to see that in our country,
we now have over 50,000 deaths from the coronavirus &#8211; and the numbers of cases
in Illinois continue to climb. Broken hearts as people are ill &#8211; as people
grieve. And then this past week, to hear that we will not be able to be gather for
worship in our sanctuary for at least another 5 weeks! Broken-hearted &#8211; I must
admit. I know I am truly missing all of you!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoTitle" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But I am continually claiming the verse from Psalm 34:18 &#8211;
<i>&#8220;The Lord is close to the brokenhearted; He rescues those whose spirits are
crushed.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span></i>Let me say that one more
time &#8211; it&#8217;s a great verse to remember &#8211; especially when we are walking through
these difficult times:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>&#8220;The Lord is
close to the brokenhearted; He rescues those whose spirits are crushed.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoTitle" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A disciple named Cleopas and his companion discovered the
power of this verse as they met the risen Lord on the road to Emmaus on that
first Easter. They were walking on that road, broken hearted, with spirits
crushed &#8211; and suddenly the risen Lord walked among them. Let&#8217;s hear that story
right now. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoTitle" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN-US"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoTitle"><i><span style="" lang="EN-US">LESLIE WILT READS THE SCRIPTURE<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="MsoTitle" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thanks Leslie! And thanks be to God for those words.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoTitle" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><span style="" lang="EN-US"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Think about these two followers of Jesus. They were walking
down the road to Emmaus, a little village 7 miles west of Jerusalem. They were
going home in defeat, shame, and disappointment. It was late in the evening and
the sinking sun reminded them of the sinking feeling they had on the inside. They
had faced the sunset of Good Friday, watching Jesus die on the cross and they
felt all hope was gone. They were walking along a dark and lonely path, brokenhearted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="" lang="EN-US"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But as they walked along, a stranger
joined them. He asked what they had been discussing. They stopped dead in their
tracks, looked at each other and then asked him if he was the only person who
did not know what had been going on the last few days. He asked them what things
they were talking about. They said, &#8220;about Jesus of Nazareth, a mighty prophet
and how he had been put to death.&#8221; Then they said, "But we had hoped he
was the one to redeem Israel."<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">"We had
hoped" -- what sad and tragic words. These two followers had lost all
their hope. Their hope had literally been buried in Jerusalem! But things soon
changed. God would take their dashed hopes and dreams and give them new life. Because
of their visit with this stranger, they would never be the same again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The stranger walked with them all the way to Emmaus,
teaching them all about the scriptures and prophecies. He told them so much and
they wanted to hear more. So, they invited him to come and stay with them. They
sat down at the table for a meal together. He blessed the bread and broke it. Then
he gave it to them. There was something strangely familiar in all of that. And
then Luke writes, "Their eyes were opened, and they recognized
him."<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Suddenly everything was
different. The entire situation was transformed. Nothing would ever be the same
again. After Jesus disappeared from them &#8211; they said, <i>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t our hearts
burn within us as He talked with us on the road and explained the Scriptures to
us?&#8221; </i><span style="">&nbsp;</span>They had gone from having
hearts that were broken to hearts burning with great joy and hope. And within
the hour, the disciples turned around and ran to Jerusalem and told everyone
the good news: &#8220;The Lord has risen indeed!&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="" lang="EN-US"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How often we are just like those followers. We are
overcome by grief and anxiety. We are so worried about what our future holds
and keep our eyes focused on the negative. We are tempted to angry or depressed
&#8211; or just give up; thinking nothing is ever going to go right. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="" lang="EN-US"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But the good news is that we have a traveler who walks
along beside us &#8211; someone who understands what it means to suffer. Someone who
understands what it means to lose a loved one in death and what it means to
struggle with God&#8217;s will for your life. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Someone who understands what it means to be
beaten and what it means to face death. That traveler is Jesus who is walking
beside us, every step of the way. And when we take the time to open our eyes and
<span style="">&nbsp;</span>look for Him in the midst of our experiences,
He can give us the power and the strength to turn around and get us on the
right road that leads to the sunrise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="" lang="EN-US"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="" lang="EN-US">We can get
on that right road that leads to joy and hope, when we remember that Christ is
with us, guiding us and never, ever leaving us!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Jesus said, &#8220;I am with you always!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>He is alive and will never abandon us!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="" lang="EN-US"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When our thinking has been gripped
by that conviction, then we can face anything that comes along. When our hearts
burn within us with the conviction that Jesus is with us and will give us
power, we know we can handle all of life, its ups, and its downs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once during a time when Martin
Luther was greatly troubled, some of his friends saw him writing with his
finger in the dust on the table, "He lives. He lives."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe that is what we should do with those
hearts &#8211; write the words: "He lives. He lives!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Because
He lives, I can face tomorrow!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
then maybe, just maybe, our broken hearts will begin to be healed! And maybe, during
this time, <span style="">&nbsp;</span>our eyes will be opened and
we&#8217;ll see how our Redeemer is walking among us &#8211; and hear His voice &#8211; and we&#8217;ll
know &#8211; we&#8217;ll never be the same!</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;" lang="EN-US"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
